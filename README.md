# Q 4: Dependencies of my virtual environment 
a. Python version: 3.7.9
1. The package I manually installed: matplotlib 3.3.2 by the command
```
pip install matplotlib
```
2. The dependency list extracted by the command
```
pip freeze
```
- certifi==2020.6.20
- cycler==0.10.0
- kiwisolver==1.3.0
- matplotlib==3.3.2
- numpy==1.19.2
- Pillow==8.0.1
- pyparsing==2.4.7
- python-dateutil==2.8.1
- six==1.15.0

The dependency list has more packages than the package I manually installed. The other packages are also installed because matplotlib requires those dependencies. 

b. ".gitignore" file has the environment folder "dsci560H4." 

c. "requirements.txt" was generated by the command
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
